### Product Vision

To be the definitive tool for analyzing fantasy football manager performance by providing deep, transaction-based insights into player history and value. The application will empower users to settle the debate of who is the best manager by evaluating skill in drafting, trading, and waiver wire acquisitions.

### Core Features

1.  **Comprehensive Player Lifecycle Tracking:**
    *   **Transaction Timeline:** For any given player, visualize their complete history within the league:
        *   Initial draft (round, pick number).
        *   All trades they were a part of.
        *   Instances of being dropped and claimed (waiver wire).
    *   **Performance Analysis:** Chart a player's fantasy performance (points per game) over time, with clear markers for transactions like trades to visualize their performance before and after moving to a new team.

2.  **Advanced Trade Analysis:**
    *   **Trade Tree Visualization:** Show the full impact of trades, especially those involving draft picks. If a pick is traded, the tree will follow that pick to show which player was eventually selected and how they have performed.
    *   **Net Value Calculation:** Quantify the value gained or lost in a trade by comparing the fantasy output of the assets received versus the assets given away over a subsequent period.

3.  **Manager Skill Evaluation:**
    *   **Roster Breakdown:** On a manager's team page, clearly label how each player was acquired (e.g., "Drafted," "Trade," "Waiver") and when the acquisition occurred.
    *   **Drafting Grade:** Analyze the value a manager gets from their draft picks compared to the pick's position (e.g., finding a top-10 player in the 5th round).
    *   **Waiver Wire Prowess:** Highlight successful waiver wire pickups by showing players who significantly outperformed expectations after being acquired as free agents.
